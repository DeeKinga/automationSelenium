# automationSelenium
My first automated testing with Python Selenium.</br> 
The site that was tested was https://www.demo.guru99.com/V4/ for a login page. I have automatized 6 test cases, where I tested if I could log in with the correct and incorrect credentials.  
Realizing these tests I have been focused on finding the elements on the page by different locators.
