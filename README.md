# automationSelenium
My first automated testing with Python.</br> 

**Inspiration and personal purpose**</br>
___
This automation project was created in order to apply practically my knowledge of Selenium framework.I have automatized 6 test cases, where I tested if I could log in with the correct and incorrect credentials. Realizing these tests I have been focused on finding the elements on the page by different locators.</br>

**Project technologies**</br>
___
* **Python** as a programming language </br>
* **Selenium** as an automation framework for web application<br/>
* **Google Chrome** as test browser</br>
