# automationSelenium
My first automated testing with Python.</br> 

**Inspiration and personal purpose**</br>
This automation project was created in order to apply practically my knowledge of Selenium framework.</br>

**Project technologies**</br>
+**Python** as a programming language </br>
+**Selenium** as an automation framework for web application<br/>
+**Google Chrome** as test browser</br>

The site that was tested was https://www.demo.guru99.com/V4/ for a login page. I have automatized 6 test cases, where I tested if I could log in with the correct and incorrect credentials.  
Realizing these tests I have been focused on finding the elements on the page by different locators.
